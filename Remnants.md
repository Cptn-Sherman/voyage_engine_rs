**Weapons:**
- Weapons are just collections of **damage multipliers**.
    - Slash, Stab, Cleave, Blunt, & Pierce
    - values that deviate from the defaults
- Weapons should be more about play style and combat flow feel rather than min-maxing numbers. Does it feel good to use this weapon and does it look cool or does this weapon deal the max damage. Maybe player skills represent the damage, and the weapons just have a multiplier. For example, a rapier may have a x0.5 damage multiplier to slash but x2.5 to stab. Or something like that. Additionally, a weapon may have a special tag like (clunky, or brutal) witch further modifies the multipliers in a negative and/or positive way. Maybe a clunky weapon is slower. A tool is only as good as the hand holding it. There are no “special tools” that do more damage without changes to the wielder.
- When a Weapon breaks it’s a random chance to select either Minor Damage, Moderate Damage, Severe Damage and lastly Unfixable Damage. The higher being more rare. This affects the repair cost.

**Magic, Enchantments, & Curses:**

- Enchanted items are bound to a user during creation.
- Enchanted items become cursed when abandoned for long periods of time, like a Mokumokuren (Japanese spirits that manifest in neglected household objects). Healing a cursed item requires a purification process to remove the curse and rebind the item to a new user.
- Cursed items are usable but have side effects. For instance, a flaming sword may cause burn damage to the wielder, or a bag of holding may refuse to open for periods of time.


Magic:

- **Magical Incantation** - Incantation is a dangerous process, attempting to perform a high-level incantation while under-level can be deadly. If, for instance, a low-level mage was to attempt extremely high-level magic the player could disintegrate; leaving only a charred spot on the floor where they stood. Perhaps passersby would hear the last screams of the foolish mage who meddled with magic beyond their comprehension. nb 
- **The study of magic** is the study of **runes and symbols** that when combined allow the user to create unique effects. Magically users have a few options when it comes to learning new spells and incantations. Spells the user wishes to use in combat without long cast times need to be recorded in a **grimoire**. This recording must be done while resting at a campfire or while seated for a minimum of one hour. There are limited slots in each grimoire, however they often come with buffs and effects making certain schools of magic more effective. Those who attempt to memorize spells can do so without a grimoire with great damage to their sanity. A player with damaged sanity will experience strange phenomena including seeing dialogue on the screen that has no origin, having subtle changes to their appearance occur overtime then swap back, intense magically outbursts, seeing strange eldritch beings while others cannot, and much more. The benefits to the insanity route to magic include access to eldritch magic, the use of taboo and strange fetishes to increase magical power.



**Professions:**

- **Alchemist** is the process of combining materials to produce desired effects. Each ingredient will have a maximum of 4 effects both positive and negative. Ingredients with powerful positive effects often have powerful negative effects as well. Combining the same effect will increase the power and combining opposite effects will cancel out. An experienced alchemist will combine like effects to create a powerful potion while also canceling out the negative side effects.
- Blacksmith -
- Merchant -

**Building Mechanics & Structures:**

- **Clay furnace** - a simple furnace that quickly cracks after a few uses. Can be used to create charcoal, smelt metals with a low melting point, and cook foods.
- **Stilts** structures used to lift buildings off the ground or water. Buildings built in the swamps are often built on stilts to keep dry and safe.
- **Adobe buildings** - towns in the swamps will also build homes out of mud mixed with plant fibers (adobe) then heating them from within to harden the mud into a clay-like material.
- **Crystal Networks** are used to power magical artifacts, bring life to golems, and lift entire cities into the sky. As well as powering more mundane quality of life technology like interior lighting, stable teleportation portals.
- **Piles of gold** coins are a type of block. They can be found in a dragon’s lair and large treasure vaults and can be picked up by hand and placed in the player’s coin pouch.
- **Ropes & Pulleys & Gears** - A system of ropes, pulleys, counterweights, and gears can be created and arranged to create and perform mechanical work. Elevators, drawbridges, and complex machinery can be constructed by talented builders.
- **Building Flags & Blueprints** - Buildings are made in a build mode after placing a flag down on the ground, the blueprint is then passed to a contractor or construction team to build the house. Small, medium, or large blueprints can be made.

**Services & Establishments:**

- **Services in the game utilize a simple system** to allow the game to both generate these structures automatically, allow the non-player characters to be able to interact and utilize these systems and allow the player to create and run their own services. This system includes providing display signs that draw attention to the service, open and close signs, advert signs, sale signs, point of sale tables, product display shelves and stands, dining tables, room numbering signs and keys for inns. This system should provide the ability to define a space for a set purpose like defining the shop front, or individual rooms at inns, or the dining room at restaurants and bars.
- **Inns -** Inns appear in almost every settlement, often at varying price levels. Inns can be rented out for up to 1 month at a time, provide meals and clean the room. Most inns are also taverns, providing food for the occupants/tenants.
- **Taverns -** A tavern is a service location that provides food and alcoholic beverages. Taverns pull larger numbers of clients later at night and are often associated with the less moral aspects of the settlement.
- **Market Squares and Streets -** Areas designated by shops that open and set up early in the day and close and return home later in the day. The streets are busy and form maze-like pathways between sellers.

**Guilds:**

**Guild Halls -** any settlement that is large enough to classify as a town will have guild halls. These guild halls will teach new skills, provide jobs or quests, and act as part of a larger network in the civilized towns. Most settlements have an adventurer's guild, merchant’s guild, and mages guild. Larger cities usually have one of all guild types. Guilds act as derivatives of services, which the player cannot run (probably) and are limited to only a single instance per location.

- **Adventure Guild -** Almost all settlements that accept travelers and merchants will have an adventurer's guild. This guild's main purpose is to connect skilled adventurers to contract work in and around the settlement. This guild is responsible for displaying job requests, holding onto client payments, affirming job completion, and rating player adventure level to prevent players selecting overly difficult quests.
- **Merchants Guild -** Used to facilitate trade between neighboring settlements, host auctions, purchase and sell items from other guilds. Collects tax on transactions.
- Warriors Guild -
- Mages Guild -
- Scholars Guild -

**Actors & Entities:**

- **Players have 3 Main states with two sub-stats each.** Body composed of Agility and Vigor. Mind composed of Perception and Intelligence. Spirit is composed of constitution and wisdom. These stats do not level up during game play, they are set at the beginning of character creation and stay the same during play. As the player levels instead, they will select new traits to add to their character in the form of skills (body), Knowledge (mind), and Revelations (Spirit). Furthermore, players will define their character's personality (Agreeable, extraversion, conscientiousness, openness, and emotional stability) which will change through play as well as provide additional traits for the player to be granted rather than selected. Traits both selected and personality will “level up” through use. For example, a player using one-handed weapons will
- **Species →Subspecies →Ancestry** taxonomy helps categorize what an entity is. For instance, Ashen Elves would have a species humanoid, subspecies elvish, and the ancestry of ashen. Ancestry defines the cultural group rather than the genetic species.
- **Moods, motivations, and personality** traits are based on the 5 major personality traits. (Openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional stability ranging in value from 0.0 to 1.0). Certain values will unlock traits the player and high priority non-player characters can select while also impacting dialogue choices and character actions.
- **Traits** - Players will **select traits at the beginning of the game** and can **acquire more during play**. These traits should make significant changes to the player style of the character, however, should remain optional. For instance, every fifth level a player increases they should be given the option to select a new trait based on the kinds of experiences they have had. A player that has resolved many quests by avoiding combat and engaging in persuasion could be given a bonus to their relationship with the non-player character if they are successful in convincing them.
- **Wellbeing & Hygiene** - Players need to **eat, drink, sleep and maintain hygiene,** else they suffer negative effects. These could be reduced stats like health, mana, and stamina or could even cause the player to fail more regularly. Low Hygiene could result in failed persuasion or social checks requiring the player to stay clean to interact with non-player characters.
- **Starting Partner(s) Personality** - during the new game creation process, after designing the player character, the player can design partners. These may include romantic partners, rivals, or any character they wish to interact with. These characters can have set personalities by taking a personality survey and making decisions on how they would handle hypothetical situations. Alternatively, the user can use sliders to set the character's personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional stability ranging in value from 0.0 to 1.0).
- **Priority System** - A priority system will be used to limit the amount of data used on inconsequential actors (little interaction with the player or basic mobs). These low priority actors will require fewer bytes to be stored in memory and will follow a more generalized scheduling and job system. If a low priority character begins to be interacted with more by the player this character can have its priority level increased and will have more depth. These characters can generate quests for the player to complete or will be weaved into working narratives.
- **Sheath weapons in populated areas** - In populated areas not owned by the player character, having a weapon in hand will cause people to dislike the player. Some may ask the player to sheath their weapon(s) or become hostile if ignored.
- **NO EVIL Entities -** other than gods. Making entities inherently evil adds no value to the entity. Entities can be hostile by default to certain factions, races, or subspecies however this is not evil. Goblins for instance are inherently hostile to humanoids but they are not evil. Their reasons are logical and are the result of incompatible cultures and a basic need for survival.
- **Players start with 3 quick slots** at the beginning of the game. New belts with pouches can increase both carrying capacity and the number of quick slots (max 10 due to the number of numerical keys on the keyboard).
- **Players have 3 base stats (Health, Mana, and Stamina**) used to indicate the player’s status. Each is affected by a buildup that will negatively impact the amount of these three resources available. Health is directed by the saturation of hunger and thirst. A player that has not eaten or drunk will have lower health and will recover at a reduced rate. Mana is impacted by (something I have not thought of yet) and stamina Is impacted by exhaustion which is how often and much sleep the player has gotten. At first, the recovery rates are affected, and as the accumulation becomes severe the total amount of the resource is greatly decreased.
- **Entities must follow the same rules as the player**. No one enjoys fighting enemies that have infinite stamina only to make it more challenging.
- **Loot-able creatures -** and objects should drop lots of items. These items could range from bones, meat, blood, hides, teeth, and much more. Some items will not be displayed unless a specific action like butchering or skinning is performed on the entity.
- Players as well as non-player characters will have **lowered health pools** when compared to games like Skyrim. Providing an emphasis on **smarter gameplay** than wildly flailing to attack all enemies.
- **Entities should be able to engage in combat** with one another based on faction alignment.

**Notes & Other Unsorted:**

- Fell trees by mining the trunk. You will leave a truck piece behind, cannot get the whole tree at once.
- Sound physics - Reverb, material dampening
- Connectable rope and chain entities. Part of climbing system and hook shot
- Air particles, dust, sand, snow, etc.
- In Minecraft the enchantment table letters that float from the bookcase to the enchantment table should speed up their movement as they get closer so a curve that not linear.
- Biome/weather based particles
- Voxels should obey gravity, if you break the base of a tree, the whole tree falls.
- Spyglass for traveling and exploring
- Buy map information at guilds for new area, detailed. Maybe a continent map is given at the start.
- Ore, minerals, and crystal formations can be found in any rock type. You may find different densities of metals in different locations.
- Subsurface scattering with pixel textures is going to look really cool
- Small personal ships for 1 or 2 with storage, fishing nets, sails, anchors
- Water splash effects
- Falling leaves with subsurface scattering
- Rain plips on water surfaces, bubbles underwater
- Lots and lots of crops
- Walnut trees
- Lots of animals, develop controllers for quadrupedal, bipedal, flying, etc.
- Road signs pointing to places, signs with
- Ropes and chains attachable or string-able, climbable
- Travel tents, hammocks, bedrolls,
- Carriages and carts, plow
- Cartography tools for determining elevation, latitude and longitude, and tracking movement through the use of a skill and set of tools. Maybe you could have a member of the part help track your movements if you don’t invest in the skill.
- Voxels need to define passthrough directions, for instance a hollow log should allow water to move from one side of the voxel to another unobstructed. This could be for liquid pipes or for air chutes. You could install metal pipes to move hot air. Pneumatics, Hydraulics, trains, water pumps, etc.
- Cannons & Powder guns
- Crates
- Realistic strata
- More biome based zombies, bog men, ice wraiths, pirates, etc.
- Cooking pots like Thermopolium and vintage story
- Tender, flint and steel, primitive fire starting with skill, campfires crucible and temp clay furnaces like vintage story.
- Bounty boards in the guild or in public square in small towns.

# **Key
Questions**

**Should Remnants implement a main
storyline?**

Probably not…

**If not, could an abstract story
about the gods work in place of a main storyline?**

This could be a good solution to a lack of main story that
doesn’t impede players and modders making their own worlds in Remnants.

**What’s the surface level story?**

Join the adventurer’s guild and progress through the ranks.
Learn of the return of a demon lord guy and work with the guild to find out how
to stop it.

**Should the game include firearms?**

My worry is that firearms would logically be the best weapon to
use. If firearms remain powder-based weapons rather than cartridge based could
offer a balance.

**What kind of Tech, if any, should
be found in remnants world? And how does this tech compete with magic
alternatives?**

# **Concepts**

**Races:**

Do not handicap the races by their inspiration, if something
needs to change then change it. Races define aspects of physical appearance and
will have no impact on ability or natural talent.

**Ashen Elves**

Ash or gray-skinned elves, with patches of light skin like the
genetic condition Vitiligo. Some have silver tattoos.

**Solar Elves**

Elves with warm sun-tanned skin traditionally adorned with
tribal pattern tattoos.

**Lunar Elves**

Elves of the polar and subpolar regions. Pale white & grey
skin. Traditional garb involves spotted cat fur adorned around the neck.

**Painted Elves**

Elves with desaturated colorful skin tones of warm reds,
oranges, blues, and many other colors. These elves

**Dryad**

Living wood that has taken root in the skeleton or corpse of a
fallen adventurer. The wood forms a bark skin around the bones. Often ribs,
sections of the skull or leg bones will poke out from beneath the bark. Their
heads are adorned with leaves, fungus, or moss mimicking hair or beards.

**Caimen**

Denizens of the most humid climates; the swamps, marshes, and
lakes. The Caiman has thick, tough skin which acts as natural protection. They
also are well adapted to swimming for long periods of time without coming up
for air. As cold-blooded creatures, they struggle in the colder climates and
require much more clothing than other races. Settlements of caiman located on
dry land often build domed shaped huts out of a mixture of wet mud and fibrous
material, lighting a fire inside at the center to dry out and harden the
material. Some settlements will choose to build over the water if there is
limited land. These groups will build homes of wood lifted above the water on
stilts. The Caimen travel through the waterways using gondolas or small
rowboats, moving through the water silently.

**Reptilian Folk**

**Orc**

The orcs are a group bound by honor and tradition. Orcs make
excellent warriors and excel using traditional Japanese styled weaponry. The
Orcs have a strong respect for the environment and nature; they avoid
disturbing the natural rhythm of their environment as much as possible.

**Tiefling**

Semi nomadic race, which travels with great monstrous beasts.
Building tents off the sides and on the body of said beasts. Those that do not
relocate construct homes from the bones of these creatures. Dark skin with pale
colored eyes. Or pale skin with dark eyes.

**Avian**

Inspired by pre-Columbian Native Americans, the Avian are a race
of humans with bird features. Avian are semi-nomadic tribes that live in
grasslands, woodlands, as well as hot desert climates. Avian favor using bows
and ranged weaponry but also use Native American style axes and spears. Mayan,
Incan, and Aztec if more civilized or in dense jungles.

**Human**

**Bear Folk**

Inspired by Norse culture the bear folk of the game are located
primarily in the northernmost areas.

**Cat Folk**

**Wolf Folk**

**Satyr**

Adorned with warpaint, antlers and deer ears pointed downwards.
Hooved feet with retrograde leg joint the amount of leg fur varies but usually
extends slightly above the hips or the lower abdomen.

**Serpent Folk**

Living in both dry arid deserts and Savanna to the dense and
humid swamps, the snake folk of remnants live in both extremes of moisture
across the world.

**Dwarves**

Celtic influenced dwarves.

**Trolls**

Subterranean beings that only venture above ground during the
night to capture livestock or sometimes even other sentient beings. Their diets
consist heavily of meat and mushrooms that grow extensively in the caves they
inhabit.

**Weapons Styles/Motifs:**

- **Petrified Amber** – Hardened amber stones chipped and carved into intricate weaponry.
- **Feather Arrows** - Arrows can gain benefits from the feathers on the end. For example, owl feathers may provide a much quieter arrow, aiding in stealth.
- **Bronze Leaf** - These weapons are made of bronze adorned with leaf designs.
- Pinecone Hammer & Mace -
- **Autumn Leaves** - armor and weapons made from leaf patterns, often yellow, orange with hints of green.

**Objects & Items:**

- The Skull of Excessive Orbits -
- **Living Armor -** Heavy plate armor cloaked in dense moss and plant life. The armor grants a slow heal during the daytime but cannot be equipped during the night.

**Flora:**

- **Toad Shade** – a mushroom that grows best in wet climates. It has a very flat top and wide diameter, appearing like an umbrella. Often small toads and frogs are found beneath the mushrooms during the daytime.
- **Muck Root** - A thick root found at the base of wide ferns found in marshes and swamps. The Root is rich in nutrients and a staple food of those that live in the area.
- **Pale Oak** - Dark black barked trees with pale white leaves. The core wood inside is a light gray color and makes wonderful weapon handles and bow timber.
- Cat-tails

**Creatures:**

- **Armor Eater** - a gelatinous slime that degrades the armor of those it attacks, preferring softer metals that can be easily broken down.
- **Ash Ray** - flying rays that live in the warm ash surrounding active volcanoes. During the night they sleep underneath the ashes to maintain temperature.
- **Oak Drake** - Dragon made of living wood and old bones. Passive and protectors of the forests. Often have a beard of moss with branch-like antlers.
- **Mimics**  are Mokumokuren (Japanese spirits that manifest in neglected household objects) that take up in chests when they have been left locked up for too long or left empty for extended periods. These mimics can be hostile and can be tamed for a storage container that follows the player.
- **Slimes**  Slimes are creatures powered by an enchanted stone. An intricately carved stone that gives like to the inanimate sludge or liquid in which it is placed or dropped. Removing this stone will cause the slime to cease to hold its form and spill out on the floor.
- Hard Bark Sprites -
- Mineral and Metallic Dragons -
- Arcane Skeletal Beings-

**Points of Interest:**

- **Lady of the frozen lake –** A reference to King Arthur and the lady of the lake who possesses Excalibur. The lady of the frozen lake is perfectly preserved beneath the ice’s surface holding a blade hilt above the ice. A player could take the blade if they are strong enough to draw it from its icy sheath. However, little is to be done for the now deceased lady of the lake.

**Major Patch Ideas:**

- **Twisted Winds & Raging Earth** - Focusing on wind and earth related natural disasters, their impacts on the populations and fantasy elements related to beasts that control and utilize these forces.
    - Wailing Totems warn of incoming wind events.
    - Terra Totems warm of incoming geological events.
    - New weather features: Tornados, Hurricanes, Sandstorms, Blizzards, flooding, intense winds
    - New Geological features: Earthquakes, Volcanic Eruptions, Pyroclastic events, landslides, sink holes, Volcanic lava flows

- **Full Sails & Crushing Depths** - Focusing on sea exploration and underwater structures & biomes. Adding ships to sail, creatures inhabiting the seas, and natural weather phenomena originating in the sea (maelstroms).

# **Lore:**

Lore heavily influenced by cosmic horror. Where other fantasy
games and worlds have citizens worship and pray to gods or supernatural
entities. The gods of the worlds of Remnants have long been dead. The world is
a dream hosted by higher beings, far beyond what a mere god could do.

First born children (sprits) of the trinity have the greatest
power. One of them is lunae (the moon)

Knowledge is often a physical thing to the sprits & gods.
When flame was stolen the god quite literally could no longer utilize fire.

**Story thing…**

At the beginning was conflict

A conflict between opposites

Between light and dark

Creation and Destruction

Birth and Decay.

That dyad once present,

Mangled and twisted, in horrendous congregation.

Would behold the third,

That gentle gossamer infinity

Which lulled them with times gentle flow, again...

Those three how they danced,

Enraptured in cardinal contemplation.

In their slumber they conceived a trifling epiphany

And drew fourth from that vacuous place

That which would form all things.

Birthing those pitiful barren planes

And those beings hitherto unconceived

Constructs of indescribable geometries.

That Barren thing writhing and tormented

Upon which stirred no existence

Drew a pity from those indescribable beings

Which cast upon this desolate place tormentous mercy.

Thus decreed this assemblage to beget life upon that pitiful
thing

And from their corpus took substance,

Conceived and sculpted with callous fervor.

Upon this place they discharged their creations

Forsaking them upon that place

Ordained to entropy.

{incomplete}

Oyr bestowed that sacred boon

A flickering warmth

Born of a grand betrayal

Which robbed other beings of that flickering light

[pitiful things – aka humans]

What ignorance to profess themselves worthy of a god’s thoughts

Let alone that they could withstand its ruminations

Only within an impalpable dream could they bear it

Long ago the two worlds were divided.

One day the humans flee their planet to the planet of the elves,
and dwarves.

Evil follows them

Now the evil is coming to the Elven world.
